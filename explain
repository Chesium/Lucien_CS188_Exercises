Given a character board, your goal is to find the target word in the board.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or
vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

Return 'Yes!' or 'No!' as your answer. Any other answers shall be viewed invalid.

Several examples following:
Example1:
Puzzle:   Target:
A B C E   See
S F C S
A D E E

Then the player should just return 'Yes!'.
If the player returns 'No!', then the system shall return:
Pity~ The relative position of the target word in the puzzle is:
* * * *
* * * S
* * E E

Example2:
Puzzle:   Target:
A B C E   Bee
S F C S
A D E E

Then the player should just return 'No!'.
If the player returns 'Yes!', then the system shall return:
Pity~ There's actually no target word in the puzzle...
